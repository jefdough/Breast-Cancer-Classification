# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This is an example of classification techniques using the breast cancer data set from sci-kit learn.

All of the features provided are used in the models, however I test each model using the raw features, scaled features, and the principal components of the features.

The models used are:<br>
-Logistic Regression<br>
-KNN<br>
-Decision Tree<br>
-Random Forest<br>
-SVC<br>

At the end of the notebook I display the three best models using a ROC curve with a AUC calculation.
