# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This is an example of classification techniques using the breast cancer data set from sci-kit learn.

All of the features provided are used in the models, however I test each model using the raw features, scaled features, and the principal components of the features.

The models used are:
-Logistic Regression
-KNN
-Decision Tree
-Random Forest
-SVC

At the end of the notebook I display the three best models using a ROC curve with a AUC calculation.
